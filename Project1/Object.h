	 *      the other object.
	 *
	 * \returns One of the following characters:
	 *      'n' : No collision occurred
	 *      'y' : A collision occurred, but not in a simple direction (i.e. two circles)
	 *      'v' : The other object hit this object's top or bottom edge (a vertical collision)
	 *      'h' : The other object hit this object's left or right edge (a horizontal collision)
